For study resources I used the <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-network-forensics-threat-hunting-incident-response/">SANS: FOR572</a> online video series, slides and books. I didn’t dedicate a ton of time into studying. Infact this probably took me nearly 100 days from the time I purchased the exam attempt and actually taking the exam. Within the 100 days were weeks when I didn’t crack a book or start a video.</p><h3 id="sans-for572">SANS FOR572</h3><p>In the SANS FOR572 series <a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/philip-hagen/">Phil Hagen</a>(<a href="https://twitter.com/PhilHagen">@PhilHagen</a>) does a really great job of bringing you up from Zero-to-Hero throughout the course. In my opinion you <em>definitely</em> should have some basic experience in networking, security concepts like boundary defense, and understanding how things look on the wire and how they <strong>should</strong> look on the wire. If you only have a couple years of <strong>good experience</strong> in the field, spanning multiple domains, you should have no problem keeping up with the material. If you have less experience, it doesn’t mean you <strong>can’t</strong> pass the exam but, it may be more difficult. Phil speaks clearly and delivers the material very well, mixed with tales of personal experiences.</p><p>While I haven’t been doing incident response or digital forensics at all as part of my day job, I regularly participate in CTF’s chasing flags through an environment or hunting for flags through PCAPs. Most of the tools used throughout the course material I have running in production environments or have running here at my home for network visibility and “research”. I spent most of my career around traditional networking and network security products like firewalls, IPSs, Proxies and more. I understand multi-vendor and multi-capability security stacks well. So, when I saw the tools and concepts Phil Hagen was presenting in the material it felt very comfortable.</p><h3 id="the-exam">The Exam</h3><p>I come from a Cisco testing background having gone from CCNA to CCIE, I was happy to NOT see what are know in the industry as “Cisco Style Questions” where there are multiple correct answers and you have to pick the <em>most correct</em> answer. Instead, the GIAC: NFA exam was clear and there was a single answer for each question. This alleviates a lot of frustration that can sometimes occur through certification exams. I finished the exam with lots of time to spare.</p><h4 id="testing-outline">Testing outline:</h4><ul><li>50 questions</li><li>2 hours</li><li>Open Book !!!</li></ul><p>This was the first exam I’ve ever taken that was an open book test. It was weired and frankly I forgot to reference them throughout the test. There were a few questions where I paused as I was looking over the multiple choice answers and remembered: “Oh right, I can look this up!”, I would thumb through the book to the relevant section and skim and page or two until I could verify my intended answer. Without the books I still would’ve passed but not gotten as high of a score.</p><h3 id="index-method">Index Method</h3><p>I did not use the index method. I read as much as I could about this and watched a few ‘how-to’ videos but I just didn’t understand it. I started a spreadsheet but got about 25-rows done and gave up. It’s not for me. I see the value in it so I’m happy it works for many others but it’s not for me.</p><h3 id="practice-exams">Practice Exams</h3><p>I purchased 2 practice exams with my certification attempt. When I was about halfway through the material I took one, just to see if I was ready because frankly I was getting tired of studying and just wanted to get it out of the way. I scored well but ultimately decided to push through all the material before taking my certification attempt. The night before my certification attempt I took my 2nd practice exam and I scored even better. At that point I felt confident I would at least pass the exam, regardless of score. During the practice exams I didn’t use the books very often, 2 or 3 times maybe. I did feel like the practice exams were a good representation of the certification exam. I don’t believe they are from the same question pool, but they are similar so read the questions carefully and look at the diagrams carefully.</p><h3 id="why">Why?</h3><blockquote><p>If you don’t do DFIR why take this exam?</p></blockquote><p>I’m not sure why I pursued this as opposed to any other certifications. Personally, I always wanted to be the “anti-hacker”. The guy who could use a bunch of crazy commands CLI filtering to find the needle in the haystack. There’s something about the ‘hunt’ that I love. Also, “Network Forensic Analyst” sounds pretty cool! Ultimately, because I don’t do this everyday for a living, I just wanted a way to learn more, and by pursuing a certification with a proven curriculum of study material seemed the best way to learn.</p><h3 id="what-did-i-learn">What did I learn?</h3><p>I learned a bunch of things. There were some tools that I was unaware of such as: <a href="https://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/">silk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/phaag/nfdump">nfdump</a>, and the value of proxy logs. Also, through demonstration and exercises I learned some additional filtering and flags for various CLI tools that I needed more practice on.</p><h3 id="the-hug-of-thunder">The Hug of Thunder</h3><p>When I started this journey I put a question on on twitter to see who (if anyone) is pursuing a SANS certification other than myself. I received only a few replies but one very important was from <a href="https://twitter.com/HugOfThunder">Andre</a>. He mentioned he was just starting <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/intrusion-detection-in-depth/">SEC503</a>. We became daily DM buddies, checking in on each others progress and what we’ve learned. If it wasn’t for this encouragement I might have let this one slip. For the record SEC503 and FOR572 overlap a little bit so we had some common ground between us. I wish him the best on his exam and because of all the great things I’ve heard and seen from the course material, I look forward to completing the SEC503 exam this year too!</p><h3 id="can-you-pass-the-cert-without-the-training">Can you pass the cert without the training?</h3><p>I’m not sure I can weigh in on this. Everyone is different. I even asked this question to Phil Hagan via a Slack we have in common. I think no matter what certification you are going for you should always take the tailored training. I know, in the case of SANS, it’s expensive, but so is failing the exam. It’s a gamble. I say <strong>TAKE THE TRAINING</strong>, you’ll learn something.</p><h3 id="giac-advisory-board">GIAC Advisory Board</h3><p>Because I scored above a 90% I got an invite to the GIAC Advisory Board. It’s a mailing list with threads related to current events, certifications, and general IT and security focused queries.</p><h4 id="on-to-the-next-one"><em>…on to the next one!</em></h4></p></div></div></div></section><footer id="footer"> <!--Footer Button--><div class="container has-text-centered has-background-grey-darker" id="backtotop"> <a class="has-text-white" onclick="window.scroll(0,0)">BACK TO TOP</a></div><!--Footer Main Section--><div class="has-background-grey-darker"><div class="container columns"> <!--Name Section--><div class="column has-text-left-desktop has-text-centered-mobile"> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/#about"><div class="columns"><div class="column is-one-fifth-desktop is-one-fifth-fullhd is-one-quarter-tablet"><figure class="image is-64x64"> <img class="is-rounded" src="/assets/images/tonye.jpg"></figure></div><div class="column is-marginless"><h5 class="has-text-grey-lighter">Tony E.</h5><div class="content has-text-grey"><p>Tony E. is a network security engineer, CCIE# 64908 & GIAC: Network Fore...</p></div></div></div></a></div><!--Link Section--><div class="column has-text-white"><h3>More Links</h3><!--<li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/certifications">certifications</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/cisco-asa">cisco asa</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/eve-ng">eve-ng</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/future">future</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/giac">giac</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/goals">goals</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/google-cloud">google cloud</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/gparted">gparted</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/hex">hex</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/internet-access">internet access</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/intrusion-prevention">intrusion prevention</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/ips">ips</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/live">live</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/network-collective">network collective</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/network-field-day">network field day</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/network-forensics">network forensics</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/nfd23">nfd23</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/organization">organization</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/partitions">partitions</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/past">past</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/pcap">pcap</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/present">present</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/sans">sans</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/scapy">scapy</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/scripts">scripts</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/sharkfest">sharkfest</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/stream">stream</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/surface-pro">surface pro</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/suricata">suricata</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/t-i-w-a">t.i.w.a</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/tags">Tags</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/tcp">tcp</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/tcpdump">tcpdump</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/tracewrangler">tracewrangler</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/vyos">vyos</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/wireshark">wireshark</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/tag/zeek">zeek</a></li>--><li> <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/feed.xml">Subscribe via RSS</a></li></div><!--Blog-post Section--><div class="column has-text-white"><h3>Recent Posts</h3><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/where-to-start">Where To Start Capturing Packets</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/docker-wsl2">Docker on WSL2</a></li><li> <a href="https://blog.showipintbri.com/blog/sharkfest-2021">WiresharkFest 2021 (US)</a></li></div></div></div><div class="has-background-black has-text-centered has-text-white" id="credits"> <i class="far fa-copyright"></i> 2022 | Based on <a href="https://github.com/thedevslot/WhatATheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatATheme</a> Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a></div></footer></body></html>
